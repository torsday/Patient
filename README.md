Patient
=======

A Patient Class to create an instance of a human that has attributes (like age, weight, vitals...) that respond to changing conditions and treatments (i.e. giving epinephrine raises blood pressure).

This is not a complete project, but rather a brick in a building I'm learning to create as I go.
